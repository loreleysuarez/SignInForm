# SignInForm
Hello! This is a work in progress. It's a sign in page. My plan is to make it more dynamic and pretty with some Javascript but I'm still trying to get the hang of it so bare with me please.
For now this is what I got, mainly HTML and simple CSS. 
I am happy with the result but I know I still have a long road ahead of me. 
Thank you for reading me!
